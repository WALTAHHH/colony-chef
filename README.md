### Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Project Setup
Task: Set up the Unity project.
Install Unity Hub and the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of Unity.

Create a new 2D project.

Set up version control using Git to track changes.

## Step 2: Project Organization
Task: Organize the project structure.
Create folders: Scripts, Prefabs, Scenes, Assets, etc.

Establish naming conventions (e.g., IngredientManager.cs for scripts, ColonistPrefab.prefab for prefabs).

## Step 3: Debug Tools Implementation
Task: Create development tools for testing and debugging.
Create a DebugManager singleton for global debug controls.

Implement debug panels for:
- Time controls (pause, step, fast-forward)
- System state inspection
- Event logging and filtering
- Scenario simulation tools

Add keyboard shortcuts for common debug actions.

## Step 4: Event System Implementation
Task: Create a centralized event system for inter-system communication.
Create an EventManager singleton to handle all system events.

Implement core event functionality:
- Event registration and unregistration
- Event dispatching with cancellation support
- Debug logging of all events
- Event inspection through debug tools

Implement advanced event features:
- Event priorities for ordered processing
- Event batching for performance
- Basic validation system

Define base event types for:
- Turn phase changes
- Resource updates
- Colonist status changes
- System state changes

## Step 5: Turn Manager Implementation
Task: Create a turn manager to control the game loop.
Implement a TurnManager script to handle the four phases: Resource Assessment, Preservation & Preparation, Colony Management, and Resolution.

Use coroutines to manage phase transitions smoothly.

## Step 6: Data Persistence
Task: Implement save/load functionality.
Create a SaveManager to handle data serialization.

Define serializable data structures for:
- Game state
- Ingredient inventory
- Colonist status
- Equipment status

Implement auto-save and manual save/load features.

Define persistence strategy:
- JSON format for game state saves
- PlayerPrefs for settings and small, frequent data
- Application.persistentDataPath for save location
- Simple versioning (major.minor format)
- Basic error recovery with backup saves

## Step 7: Ingredient System
Task: Build the ingredient system.
Design ScriptableObjects for ingredients with attributes like name, nutritional value, decay rate, and preservation potential.

Create an IngredientManager script to load and manage ingredients.

Implement decay mechanics to reduce ingredient quality each turn.

## Testing Milestone 1
Task: Verify core systems functionality
- Test all manager singletons
- Verify event system with basic scenarios
- Test save/load with ingredient data
- Validate turn progression

## Step 8: Preservation Mechanics
Task: Add preservation functionality.
Define preservation methods (e.g., drying, salting) and their effects on ingredients.

Create a PreservationManager script to handle preservation actions, including resource costs and success chances.

Link preservation to the ingredient system to update ingredient states.

## Step 9: Cooking & Meal Preparation
Task: Implement cooking mechanics.
Design ScriptableObjects for recipes, including required ingredients and effects (e.g., health boost).

Create a CookingManager script to combine ingredients and calculate meal outcomes.

Add UI elements for selecting ingredients and preparing meals.

## Step 10: Equipment Management
Task: Add equipment mechanics.
Define equipment types (e.g., smoker, stove) with attributes like durability.

Create an EquipmentManager script to track usage and maintenance.

Integrate equipment with preservation and cooking systems.

## Step 11: Colonist Management
Task: Build colonist mechanics.
Design a Colonist class with needs (hunger, health), skills, and traits.

Create a ColonistManager script to generate colonists procedurally and update their states.

Implement ration allocation affecting hunger, health, and morale.

## Step 12: Colony Leader AI
Task: Develop the colony leader AI.
Create a ScenarioGenerator to produce dynamic challenges (e.g., storms, shortages).

Implement a ColonyLeaderAI script to give instructions and score player performance.

Connect the AI to other systems to trigger events and update the game state.

## Step 13: UI Implementation
Task: Build the user interface.
Set up a Canvas for the main UI.

Create panels for inventory, colonist stats, and equipment using Unity's UI system.

Use TextMeshPro for text and add tooltips for extra details.

Update UI visibility based on the current turn phase.

Add UI polish:
- Simple fade transitions between states
- Basic UI animation system using Unity's built-in tools
- Consistent color scheme and style variables
- Performance optimization hooks for future animation needs

## Step 14: Art Style Implementation
Task: Apply the art style.
Install the Vector Graphics package from Unity Package Manager.

Create or source SVG assets for game elements (e.g., ingredients, colonists).

Add watercolor overlays using shaders or textured sprites.

## Step 15: Testing
Task: Test the game step-by-step.
Write unit tests for scripts (e.g., decay logic, preservation success).

Test system integration as they connect.

Playtest to balance gameplay and improve user experience.

## Step 16: Refinement
Task: Polish the game.
Tweak mechanics, UI, and art based on playtest feedback.

Optimize performance and fix any bugs.
